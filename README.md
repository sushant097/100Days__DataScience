Mainly worked with two models, logistic Regression and random Forest Classifier, are compared. The data seems imbalanced, so the random forest classifier improves the model's accuracy a bit. 

Learned and implemented :
* Data Encoding and feature scaling improves model performance. 
* Increase model complexity if the data is complex and accuracy is not improved with a simpler model. 
* Hyperparameter tuning methods like grid search improve the model accuracy as it finds the best parameters that work for the model for the given dataset.

## Day4: Bank marketing dataset to predict customer subscription behavior

🚀 On Day 4 I focused on a bank marketing dataset to predict customer subscription behavior. Here's what I accomplished:

🔍 Learned and implemented:

- 🧹 **Data Preprocessing:** Applied label encoding to handle categorical variables and standard scaling to normalize feature ranges.

- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted detailed univariate and bivariate analysis to uncover patterns and relationships in the data.

### Tackling Overfitting in Machine Learning

![](images/Day6_overfittinginml.jpg)


**What is Overfitting?**  
Overfitting happens when a model performs exceptionally well on the training data but struggles with new, unseen data. Essentially, the model becomes too complex and starts capturing noise and outliers instead of the true underlying patterns. In other words, it "memorizes" the data rather than learning from it.

**How can we reduce Overfitting?**  
Here are a few techniques to prevent overfitting:
- **Regularization:** This adds a penalty to the complexity of the model. Two popular types are L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization. They help by constraining or shrinking the coefficient values, which reduces the model's complexity.
- **Cross-validation:** Using techniques like k-fold cross-validation ensures that the model is evaluated on different portions of the data, making it more robust.
- **Simpler models:** Choosing simpler models with fewer parameters can reduce the chances of overfitting.
- **Early stopping:** This involves stopping the training process before the model starts overfitting the training data.
- **Data augmentation:** In cases like image classification, artificially increasing the size of the training data by applying transformations like rotation or flipping can help the model generalize better.

Learning to prevent overfitting is essential for building models that not only perform well on training data but also on new data.

### Understanding the Bias-Variance Tradeoff in Machine Learning


The **bias-variance tradeoff** is a crucial concept in machine learning that helps us understand the performance of our models in terms of prediction error. This tradeoff occurs when balancing two sources of error:

- **Bias**: The error caused by a model that is too simple and cannot capture the underlying patterns in the data. High bias leads to **underfitting**, where the model performs poorly on both the training data and new, unseen data.

- **Variance**: The error caused by a model that is too complex and overly sensitive to the training data. High variance leads to **overfitting**, where the model fits even the noise in the data, resulting in poor performance on new data.

### Key Concept:
- **Underfitting**: When the model has high bias and cannot capture the relationships in the data.
- **Overfitting**: When the model has high variance and fits the training data too closely, including noise.

The goal in machine learning is to **minimize the total error** by finding a balance between bias and variance, i.e., creating a model that generalizes well to new, unseen data.

### Visualizing the Bias-Variance Tradeoff:

![](images/Day7_biasvariance.png)


In the above graph:
- As **model complexity** increases, **bias** decreases, but **variance** increases.
- The **total error** (black curve) is the sum of errors from bias and variance, and the optimal model complexity is where the total error is minimized.

### How to Handle the Bias-Variance Tradeoff:
- **Increase complexity** to reduce bias (e.g., using a more powerful model).
- **Reduce complexity** to decrease variance (e.g., using regularization techniques).
- Use techniques like **cross-validation** to ensure the model generalizes well.

This tradeoff is key to building a model that neither underfits nor overfits and performs well on both the training data and unseen data.
