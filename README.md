Welcome to my **100 Days of Data Science** journey! ðŸš€

Over the following days, I'll be diving deep into data science, working on a variety of datasets, and exploring different topics within the field. Each time, Iâ€™ll be tackling new challenges, from data exploration and preprocessing to building and fine-tuning machine learning models. My goal is to document this journey and share my learnings, code, and insights with the community.

## What's Inside

- **Daily Projects**: Each time, you'll find a new project where I've applied data science techniques to solve a specific problem.
- **Code and Notebooks**: All my code and Jupyter notebooks will be available here, so you can follow along or use them as a reference.
- **Datasets**: Links to the datasets Iâ€™m using, along with a brief explanation of the problem statement and objectives.
- **Learning Resources**: Iâ€™ll also be sharing articles, tutorials, and resources that I found helpful along the way.


## How to Use This Repository

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sushant097/100Days__DataScience.git
   ```
2. **Navigate Through the Folders**: Each dayâ€™s project will have its own folder with detailed explanations and code.
3. **Run the Notebooks**: If you want to try out the code yourself, simply open the notebooks and run them in your preferred environment. Also kaggle notebook link is provided in some cases. 


## Day 1: Women's E-Commerce Clothing Reviews

On the first day, I worked with the **Women's E-Commerce Clothing Reviews** dataset. I explored the data, handled preprocessing tasks, and built a machine learning model to predict product recommendations. You can find all the details and code for this project in the Day 1 folder.

## Day 2: Predict Adult Income

On Day 2, I worked with the Adult income dataset. I focused on exploring the data, performing preprocessing, and building a machine-learning model to predict adult income >50k or not.

Mainly worked with two models, logistic Regression and random Forest Classifier, are compared. The data seems imbalanced, so the random forest classifier improves the model's accuracy a bit. 

Learned and implemented :
* Data Encoding and feature scaling improves model performance. 
* Increase model complexity if the data is complex and accuracy is not improved with a simpler model. 
* Hypertuning methods like grid search improve the model accuracy as it finds the best parameters that work for the model for the given dataset.
* Visualized the feature importance of the model: Model interpretation.
* Search and listed other ways to improve model accuracy like SMOTE for data imbalance case, model class weight adjustment such that model can focus on minority class, Ensembling methods (like stacking, boosting) is another option.
